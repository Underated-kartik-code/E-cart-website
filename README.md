# E-cart-website
# 🛒 E‑Cart – MERN‑Stack Shopping Site (Front‑end without React)

A work‑in‑progress e‑commerce web app built with **MongoDB, Express, and Node.js** on the back end and plain **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** on the front end (no React).  
The project already supports product listing and “add to cart”; more features are being added daily.

## 🚀 Implemented So Far
- **REST API** (`/api/products`) – served by Express & MongoDB
- Product grid rendered with vanilla JS fetch
- **Add to Cart** button updates cart count dynamically
- Basic mobile‑responsive layout (Flexbox)
